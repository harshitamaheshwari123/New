## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Off-white (#F9F9F9) to maintain a clean and professional appearance. Light enough to subtly show the underlying grayscale image.
- Primary color: Dark green (#1A5A3A) for the 'BUILDING' text, symbolizing growth and stability.
- Accent color: Bright orange (#FF8C00) for 'BHARAT' text and wave-shaped patterns, representing energy and aspiration. It is analogous to the green, shifted ~30 degrees on the color wheel with greatly increased brightness and saturation.
- Title font: 'Poppins', a bold sans-serif, for a clean, contemporary, and impactful headline.
- Tagline font: 'Literata', an elegant serif, for the tagline and body text to provide readability and a touch of sophistication.
- Maintain a balance between text, visuals, and whitespace to improve readability and engagement. Keep an asymmetrical grid.
- Incorporate subtle fade-in animations as users scroll to highlight different sections and provide a dynamic feel.
